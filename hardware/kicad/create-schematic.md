# Creating the schematic

First, you need to create the schematic for the desired PCB. Open the Schema Editor to get started.

Drawing the schema consists of three tasks: placing components, placing power ports and drawing connections. All three items can be selected in the right menu bar or accessed with the keyboard shortcuts A (add component), P (add power port) and W (place wire).

Place Power Port:

Place Wire:

As in all other parts of the program, you can also use M (move component), R (rotate component) and DEL (delete component).

Connect all components with wires.

Once you have completed the schematic, add **values** (i.e. labes) to the components (such as resistor value or capacitor capacity) by hovering the component and pressing V (add value). Move the values to some place where they do not interfere with your work.

You may also change the component **reference** (e.g. C1, C2, R1). Hover over the component and press U to set the reference.

Some common components:

| Component | Name |
|----|----|
| Resistor | Device:R |
| Header pin | Connector_Generic:Conn_MMxNN |
| Power input | power:+12V
